 <h1>The Best Movies According to Mubashir</h1>
 <h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>3 ediots</h3>
 <p>Perfect combination of life lessons and laughter. Points out all the flaws of our education system in a very subtle but powerful way. Teaches us to strive for excellence and not for grades.</p>
 <h3>Intern</h3>
 <p>A perfect feel good movie about how a senior person starts his life again and helps a young CEO with his experience.</p>
 <h4>SpiderMan No Way Home</h4>
 <p>The three generations of spiderman teaming together to help all the old villains is a must watch. Perfect hit of nostalgia.</p>
